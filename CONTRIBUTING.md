## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before opening an issue please:
- Search [existing issues](../../issues) to avoid duplicates.
- Confirm the bug is reproducible on the latest version.

When opening a bug report, include:
- A clear, descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the problem.
- Expected vs. actual behaviour.
- Flutter/Dart SDK versions (`flutter --version`).
- A minimal code sample or link to a reproduction repo if possible.

### Suggesting Features

- Open a [GitHub Discussion](../../discussions) or issue labelled **`enhancement`**.
- Describe the problem your feature solves and how you'd like it to behave.
- Check that the feature aligns with the package's scope (pure Dart DEFLATE, zlib and gzip compression).

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. Create a topic branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature
   ```
2. Make your changes, following the [Coding Guidelines](#coding-guidelines).
3. Add or update tests for any changed behaviour.
4. Ensure all tests pass:
   ```bash
   dart test
   dart analyze
   ```
5. Commit with a [conventional commit message](#commit-message-convention).
6. Push to your fork and open a Pull Request against `main`.
7. Fill in the PR template — describe what changed and why.
8. Address any review feedback promptly.

> **Small PRs are easier to review.** If your change is large, consider opening an issue first to discuss the approach.

## Development Setup

| Tool | Minimum version |
|------|----------------|
| Dart SDK | ^3.11.0 |

The repository is a **pure Dart package** (no Flutter dependency).

```bash
# Install dependencies
dart pub get

# Run unit tests
dart test

# Lint
dart analyze
```

---

## Coding Guidelines

- Follow the official [Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style).
- All public APIs must have **doc comments** (`///`).
- Prefer `const` constructors wherever possible.
- Do not introduce new dependencies without prior discussion in an issue.
- Keep the implementation dependency-free — no `dart:ffi` or native extensions.
- Match the existing file and folder structure under `lib/src/`.

## Commit Message Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Build process, tooling, dependencies |

**Examples:**
```
feat(decoder): support dictionary decompression
fix(block): correct offset calculation for compressed blocks
docs(readme): add limitations section
```
